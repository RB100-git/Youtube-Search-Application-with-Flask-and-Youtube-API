## Introduction
A Python web application has been created using Flask that allows users to search for YouTube videos based on a given topic and retrieves relevant video data such as video Id, video title, channel name, view count, likes count, duration and the published date. The YouTube API gives us access to YouTubeâ€™s data in a more comprehensive, scalable way than standalone YouTube embed codes would. The data is then saved to a CSV file for further analysis and can be downloaded by the user.
